# Delay-Prediction-with-Bayesian-Neural-Networks
# The folder "Dados" includes meteorological, flight, and ATFM information
# The R source code "delay_prediction.R" does some preprocessing on the dada and generates the file "final_data_sbgr.csv" to be used in the Python source codes
# The Python source code "delay_prediction_app.py" employs Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) to predict en-route delay from meteorological information using the data in the file "final_data_sbgr.csv"
# The Python source code "delay_prediction_ann.py" employs traditional/deterministic Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for the same en-route delay prediction task
